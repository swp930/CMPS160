lightedcube, pointedlight -> Original copies

lightedcubecopy successfully manipulates the shader to change the amount that
the surface is being shaded.
You can only use an attribute if it is used in the main method
lightedcubecopy also successfully uses a a_Normal reference correctly

src -> Working code for lab4. Successfully gets a_Normal also implements val
so you can change brightness of the cylinder.

srccopy -> Copy of src. Successfully moves from 7 points to 10 points. Now
need to see if it can use normal values. For some reason not able to use
a_Normal values

lightedcubecopy3 -> Normal vertex problem not shown in fact shows that it can
isolate the individual coordinates. Can draw triangles with isolated normals.
Isolated triangles can be successfully tested.

lightedcubecopy4 -> Demonstrates how to draw squares given a set of vertices in
the same way in srccopy and src.

lightedcubecopy5 -> Goraud shading in vertices
lightedcubecopy5_frag -> Phong shading with specular highlights

lightedcubecopy6 -> Trying to fix the drawSquares so it can draw one square over
another

depthshading -> Implements depth shading
