coordinates -> Gives the correct coordinates of the canvas

perspective -> Shows how projection works and the difference between orthographic
projection

perspectivecopy -> Draws two rectangles with projection perspective

perspectivecopy2 -> Attempting to draw a figure

perspectivecopy3 -> Inserting cylinder

pickface -> Shows how to pick a face of the object, demonstrates how to use
readPixels and alpha picking

pickfacecopy -> Testing out the functionality of readPixels. Works so far, want
to test out with own model, which means rgba, and no faces, so need to first
isolate shaders, change colors to 4

pickfacecopy2 -> Shows how to use readPixels

pickfacecopy3 -> Shows that you can use readPixels on multiple triangles. Also
you can switch between ortho, VP and MVP matrices

pickfacecopy4 -> Seeing how the animation works

pickobject -> Picks a whole object that is different from alpha picking

lightedcubecopy3 -> Shows how to draw triangle with the split up arrays

lightedcubecopy5 -> Goraud shading

lightedcubecopy7 -> Trying to insert projection matrix into existing code

lightedcubecopy8 -> Fixed coordinates issue

lightedcubecopy9 -> Attempting to implement gl.readPixels
