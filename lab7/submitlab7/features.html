    Notes to Grader
    <p>
        For assignment 6 after rotating about the z axis and moving it along the z axis the translation and other operations
        become a bit weird so I added a z reset button that allows you to go back to the original state without any z-related
        modifications.

        For assignment 7 you can't tell that the lighting (specular highlights) is consistent until you turn the camera left and right
        or until you pan around the object. You can also move the light positiion to see that the lighting is implemented. I rotated the camera about its z axis by modifying the up vector.
